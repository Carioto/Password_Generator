# Password_Generator

## Description
This application is a password generator.  Users have the ability to select the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters).  Then they are asked what specific characters they want to be used to create their password: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols.  password is displayed on-screen for easy copy/paste uses.

## Installation
Follow carioto.github.io/Password_Generator to begin the application.

## Usage
Use this application to create random passwords. To increase the strength of your password, set the length of the password to be longer.  Also, selecting more or all of the character options allows more possible combinations.
